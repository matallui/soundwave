## About

Play with sound waves and try to make it to the leaderboard!!!

This is a volunteer project which aims at helping kids visualizing sound waves.
The idea is to have a harmonica competition across schools/classes, so kids can use their harmonicas and see who can get the loudest.
As they play, they're provided with visual audio feedback which related to the sound waves produced by the harmonicas.

## How to Play?

Just head to https://soundwave-smoky.vercel.app and start playing!
